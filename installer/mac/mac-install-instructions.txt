xcode-select --install
# click install
# click agree

# go to xquartz.org, download and install latest XQuartz dmg

# reboot (yes, really)

# go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads and download and install the Python 3.x version (Anaconda distribution) into your Applications folder (currently Python 3.6) (NOTE: you do NOT need to enter your email on the website)

# open a new terminal window and type the following; enter your password when prompted
sudo conda update -n base conda
sudo conda install -y mpi4py

# get the graphics libraries needed by entering the following in a terminal
sudo conda install -y pyqtgraph
sudo conda install -y PyOpenGL

# go to http://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/alpha, download and install the most recent version of NEURON into your Applications folder (currently nrn-7.6.master-1712.x86_64-osx.pkg) -- NOTE: say no when asked about setting paths; we'll do that later


# to make sure all of the correct paths are followed type the following set of commands to 
# set the environment variables; note that depending on your shell (bash or c shell) you will
# use the 4 export commands below or the 4 set commands below, respectively

 # if you are using the bash shell, put the following in your ~/.bash_profile
 # (e.g. type "open ~/.bash_profile" in the terminal without the quotes to edit it):
 export PYTHONPATH=/Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
 export PATH=/Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/x86_64/bin:$PATH
 export NRN_PYLIB="/Applications/anaconda/bin/../lib//libpython3.6m.dylib"

 # if you are using the c shell (tcsh), put the following in your ~/.cshrc (and/or ~/.tcshrc)
 # (e.g. type "open ~/.cshrc" or as appropriate in the terminal without the quotes to edit the file):
 set PYTHONPATH=(/Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/lib/python $PYTHONPATH)
 set path = ($path /Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/x86_64/bin)
 set NRN_PYLIB="/Applications/anaconda/bin/../lib//libpython3.6m.dylib"

# next type the following to clone HNN's github repository (contains model/gui source-code)
git clone https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn.git


# the following command will "compile" HNN's biophysical model
cd hnn
make

# make a new terminal and we'll use that from here on out
# (We changed some settings and this is the easiest way to get them to take effect)

# at this point you can run hnn by typing the command 
python hnn.py hnn.cfg
