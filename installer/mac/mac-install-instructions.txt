# go to xquartz.org, download and install latest XQuartz dmg

# reboot (yes, really)

# go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and download and install the Python 3.x version (Anaconda distribution) into your Applications folder (currently Python 3.7)

# open a new terminal window and type the following; enter your password when prompted
sudo conda update -n base conda
sudo conda install -y mpi4py

# get the graphics libraries needed by entering the following in a terminal
sudo conda install -y pyqtgraph
sudo conda install -y PyOpenGL

# go to http://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/alpha to download and install the most recent version of NEURON into your Applications folder
#   -- NOTE: macOS Mojave (10.14.1) requires nrn-7.6.2-29-g0d801ad.x86_64-osx-py-37-36-27.pkg (or later, built after 2018-10-21)
#   -- NOTE: say no when asked about setting paths; we'll do that later


# to make sure all of the correct paths are followed type the following set of commands to 
# set the environment variables; note that depending on your shell (bash or c shell) you will
# use the 4 export commands below or the 4 set commands below, respectively

 # if you are using the bash shell, put the following in your ~/.bash_profile
 # (e.g. type "open ~/.bash_profile" in the terminal without the quotes to edit it):
 export PYTHONPATH=/Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
 export PATH=/Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/x86_64/bin:$PATH
 export NRN_PYLIB="~/anaconda3/lib/libpython3.6m.dylib"

 # if you are using the c shell (tcsh), put the following in your ~/.cshrc (and/or ~/.tcshrc)
 # (e.g. type "open ~/.cshrc" or as appropriate in the terminal without the quotes to edit the file):
 set PYTHONPATH=(/Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/lib/python $PYTHONPATH)
 set path = ($path /Applications/NEURON-7.6/nrn/x86_64/bin)
 set NRN_PYLIB="~/anaconda3/lib/libpython3.6m.dylib"

# next type the following to clone HNN's github repository (contains model/gui source-code)
git clone https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn.git


# the following command will "compile" HNN's biophysical model
cd hnn
make

# make a new terminal and we'll use that from here on out
# (We changed some settings and this is the easiest way to get them to take effect)

# at this point you can run hnn by typing the command 
python hnn.py hnn.cfg

If you see the error "mpiexec noticed that the job aborted, but has no info as to the process that caused that situation." check under view - view simulation log for a more detailed error message. If it asks about openmpi, find the location of libmpi.so and add that path to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in ~/.bash_profile
