1a. Go to - https://www.continuum.io/downloads 
1b. Download and install the Python 3.x version (currently Python 3.6) 
(NOTE: you do NOT need to enter your email on the website; just say "no thanks") 
(NOTE: Select the "Add Anaconda to the system PATH environment variable" option)
(NOTE: a later step assumes that this is installed for your Windows user; if you install
Anaconda system-wide, you'll need to adapt the instructions below in step 4 to the true location of python36.dll,
which will be c:\ProgramData\Anaconda3)

I’d make their suggestion the default with a comment that if one selected to install Anaconda for all users, to use c:\ProgramData\Anaconda3 instead.
)

2a. go to - https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download/precompiled-installers#mswin 
2b. Download and install NEURON. 
(NOTE: be sure to select the "Set DOS environment" checkbox during the install)

3a. go to - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831.aspx 
3b. Download and install Microsoft MPI 
(current version: MS-MPI v9.0.1... when asked on the next screen, select MSMpiSetup.exe)

4. Open the Control Panel, type "environment" in the search box, then select "Edit the system
environment variables", then on the next dialog, select "Environment Variables..." then "New..."
in the System variables... in the field "Variable name" enter "NRN_PYLIB" and for Variable value
"C:\Users\USERNAME\Anaconda3\python36.dll"
(Where USERNAME is your Windows username. Make sure you know what path/directory you installed
Anaconda 3.6 in – the variable value is that folder/directory where python36.dll resides; if you
installed Anaconda system-wide then the location will be c:\ProgramData\Anaconda3).
Select apply, and close that sequence of dialog boxes. 


5a. go to - http://git-scm.com/download/win 
5b. Download and install Git - (there are lots of options during install; just select the defaults)

6. open a terminal: press the windows key and the "r" simultaneously, type "cmd" (without the quotes) then enter

7. enter the following in the terminal to clone HNN's github repository (contains model/gui source-code):
git clone https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn.git

8a. On your desktop, you should have a NEURON 7.x x86_64 folder
8b. Open that, then double click on mknrndll
8c. Select "Choose directory" 
8d. Navigate to the hnn directory; (e.g. if the instructions above were followed exactly, it's
probably in C:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/hnn/mod where YOURUSERNAME represents your Windows username)
8e. Select the mod folder, 
8f. Press the "Make nrnmech.dll" button.

9a. return to the terminal window, and enter the following two commands:
 cd hnn
 copy mod\nrnmech.dll .

10. OPTIONAL: If you want to run the 3D visualizations you need to install PyOpenGL and pyqtgraph with
the following. First run the following two commands from the terminal window:
 pip install PyOpenGL
 pip install --upgrade PyOpenGL
 then download and run installer for pyqtgraph using
  http://www.pyqtgraph.org/downloads/0.10.0/pyqtgraph-0.10.0.win-amd64.exe (for 64 bit windows)
  or
  http://www.pyqtgraph.org/downloads/0.10.0/pyqtgraph-0.10.0.win32.exe (for 32 bit windows)

11. Finally, to run HNN execute the following command from the terminal from the hnn directory you cloned
in step 7 above:
python hnn.py hnn.cfg
