1. go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads and download and install the Python 3.x version (currently Python 3.6) 
(NOTE: you do NOT need to enter your email on the website; just say "no thanks") 
(NOTE: Select the "Add Anaconda to the system PATH environment variable" option)
(NOTE: a later step assumes that this is installed system-wide; if not, you'll need to adapt the
instructions below to the true location of python36.dll)

2. go to https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download/precompiled-installers#mswin and download and install NEURON. 
NOTE: be sure to select the "Set DOS environment" checkbox during the install)

3. go to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831.aspx download and install Microsoft MPI 
(current version: MS-MPI v9.0.1... when asked on the next screen, select MSMpiSetup.exe)

4. open the control panel, search for "environment" then select "Edit the system environment variables", 
then on the next dialog, select "Environment Variables..." then "New..." in the System variables... for
"Variable name" enter "NRN_PYLIB" and for Variable value "c:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\python36.dll" 
(if Anaconda was installed only for the user instead of system wide, do a search to find the true path for 
python36.dll instead). Select apply, and close that sequence of dialog boxes.

5. go to http://git-scm.com/download/win and download and install git
(there are lots of options during install; just select the defaults)

6. get a terminal: press the windows key and the "r" simultaneously, type "cmd" (without the quotes) then enter

7. enter the following on the terminal to clone HNN's github repository (contains model/gui source-code)
git clone https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn.git

8. on your desktop, you should have a NEURON 7.x x86_64 folder, open that, then double clcik on mknrndll
 select "Choose directory"
 then navigate to the hnn directory; e.g. if the instructions above were followed exactly, it's probably in C:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/hnn/mod where YOURUSERNAME represents your Windows username
 then select mod, then "Make nrnmech.dll"

9. return to the terminal window, and enter the following two commands:
cd hnn
copy mod\nrnmech.dll .

10. OPTIONAL/EXPERIMENTAL: If you want to run the 3D visualizations you need to install PyOpenGL and pyqtgraph with
the following. First run the following two commands from the terminal window:
 pip install PyOpenGL
 pip install --upgrade PyOpenGL
 then download and run installer for pyqtgraph using
  http://www.pyqtgraph.org/downloads/0.10.0/pyqtgraph-0.10.0.win-amd64.exe (for 64 bit windows)
  or
  http://www.pyqtgraph.org/downloads/0.10.0/pyqtgraph-0.10.0.win32.exe (for 32 bit windows)

11. Finally, to run HNN execute the following command from the terminal:
python hnn.py hnn.cfg
