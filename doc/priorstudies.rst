Hypothesis development/testing in prior somatosensory studies
=============================================================

Here we detail
how we applied our biophysical model of neocortex to study event-related potentials (ERPs),
alpha/beta rhythms, and gamma rhythms.  We describe how we used the model to make novel predictions
on the origin on the beta rhythm that accurately reproduce many characteristic features of MEG data
and accounts for changes in the rhythm with attention, detection, and healthy aging.
