Hypothesis development/testing in prior somatosensory studies
=============================================================

The fact that the macroscopic current dipoles sources are generated by the summed intracellular
current flow in large populations of pyramidal neuron (PN) dendrites limits the space of possible
activity patterns that can be observed at this scale. The primary currents are dominated by
subthreshold PN activity but can also reflect back-propagation of action potentials or dendritic
spikes. As such, there are commonly observed classes of signals that are measured with MEG/EEG,
consisting mainly of sensory/motor ERPs, and low frequency rhythms (typically < 100Hz).

We have used our computational neural model to study the neural origin of sensory ERPs, and low
frequency rhythms in the alpha (7-14Hz), beta (15-29Hz) and low and high gamma range (30-50Hz;
80-129Hz) range in the somatosensory system. Additionally, we have investigated the impact of
spontaneous rhythms on the filtering of sensory ERPs, and changes in these signals with
perception, healthy aging and development.

Here we detail how we applied our biophysical model of neocortex to study event-related potentials (ERPs),
alpha/beta rhythms, and gamma rhythms.  We describe how we used the model to make novel predictions
on the origin on the beta rhythm that accurately reproduce many characteristic features of MEG data
and accounts for changes in the rhythm with attention, detection, and healthy aging.
