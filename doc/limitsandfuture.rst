Limitations and Future Directions
=================================

We have built the first version of HNN, which includes
a graphical user interface on top of our biophysical model
of neocortex that generates a dipole signal
directly comparable to signals measured in MEG/EEG/ECoG
experiments, and are working on additional developments
which will enhance HNN's utility. 

One important development
avenue is integration of HNN with MNE-Python. This will provide
an enhanced workflow, allowing researchers to perform source
localization on their MEG/EEG data from HNN. Once the researchers
have performed source localization, their data will be available
within HNN for comparison with the signals generated by the
biophysical model. This will allow enhanced hypothesis testing
on the circuit-level origins of their MEG/EEG data. 

Currently, HNN runs on local workstations/laptops. In order
to reduce simulation run-time, we 
are integrating HNN with the Neuroscience Gateway
Portal (NSG). In this scenario, users will be able to load HNN on their local computers,
submit simulation jobs to NSG, and then download the results for
visualization on their local computers. NSG integration will also enable to efficiently
run multiple simulations, saving them considerable time. 

Currently HNN's biophysical model consists of a single neocortical
area. We plan to enhance HNN to support multiple, interacting neocortical
areas, as well as thalamic nuclei. This will allow researchers to test hypotheses
on how interactions between brain areas contribute to alterations in 
MEG/EEG dynamics and behavior. We will of course allow researchers
to specify all parameters associated with the different modeled brain
areas from the GUI. 

We also welcome suggestions and contributions from the community that
improve HNN.
