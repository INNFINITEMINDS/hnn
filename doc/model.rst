Model (under the hood)
======================

Here, we
describe how we created our biophysical neural model, which captures the laminar structure of cortical
columns, and how this model can be used to make predictions on the cellular and circuit level origins of
brain oscillations measured with MEG/EEG. Specifically, we describe how the model can be used to
simulate current dipole activity, the common macroscopic signal inferred from MEG/EEG data. 
While the details of the
model are specific to the somatosensory system, the model design and application are based on general
principles of cortical circuitry and MEG/EEG physics, and are thus amenable to the study of rhythms in
other frequency bands and sensory systems.
