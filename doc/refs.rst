Source-code
^^^^^^^^^^^

The HNN software and documentation is available in an open-source git
repository at https://bitbucket.org/samnemo/hnn .

cutting EEG 2017 Material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We presented the initial version of the HNN software at the cutting EEG 2017 conference in Glasgow, Scotland.
The  materials from the conference are available here.
