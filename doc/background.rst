Macroscale human brain imaging signals
--------------------------------------
Magneto-encephalography (MEG) and electro-encelphalography (EEG)
are the leading methods to non-invasively record human neural dynamics with millisecond
temporal resolution. However, it is extremely difficult to infer the underlying cellular and
circuit level origins of these "macro-scale" signals without simultaneous invasive recordings.
This limits the translation of MEG/EEG findings into novel principles of information
processing, or into new treatment modalities for neural pathologies. There is a pressing
need, and a unique opportunity, to relate the "macro-scale" signals to their underlying
circuit/cellular-level generators.

	**Primary current sources (Jp) from intracellular currents in cortical pyramidal neuron dendrites contribute
	to the detected MEG/EEG signals** The intracellular longitudinal current flow in large populations of
	synchronously activated pyramidal neurons, aligned in parallel and tangential to MEG sensors outside of the
	head, create a net primary current dipole (*e.g.*, red arrows) large enough to be
	measured. Depending on the orientation and magnitude of the current sources, the signals will either be
	measurable only by MEG or also by EEG.
