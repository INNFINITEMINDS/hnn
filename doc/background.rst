Background
===============================

Macroscale Human brain imaging signals (EEG/MEG/ECoG)
-----------------------------------------------------
MEG/EEG are the leading methods to non-invasively record human neural dynamics with millisecond
temporal resolution. However, it is extremely difficult to infer the underlying cellular and
circuit level origins of these ‘macro-scale’ signals without simultaneous invasive recordings.
This limits the translation of MEG/EEG or ECoG findings into novel principles of information
processing, or into new treatment modalities for neural pathologies. As such, there is a pressing
need, and a unique opportunity, to relate the ‘macro-scale’ signals to their underlying
"meso-scale" generators.
